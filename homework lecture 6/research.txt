•	CSS Overflow property (visible, hidden, scroll, auto, initial, inherit)
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
The overflow property has the following values:
visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

•	CSS Background (color, image, repeat, attachment, position, sizes)
background-color: a valid color name - like "red",	 a HEX value - like "#ff0000",	 an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

background-image: The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
background-image: url("paper.gif");

background-repeat: 
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;

background-attachment: 
The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):
background-attachment: scroll|fixed|local|initial|inherit;

background-position: 
The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.

•	CSS Text (align, decoration, transform, indentation, direction, shadow)
Align: The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.
When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight 

decoration: text-decoration: text-decoration-line text-decoration-color text-decoration-style text-decoration-thickness|initial|inherit;

transform: text-transform: none|capitalize|uppercase|lowercase|initial|inherit;

indentation: 
	letter-spacing	Specifies the space between characters in a text
	line-height	Specifies the line height
	text-indent	Specifies the indentation of the first line in a text-block
	white-space	Specifies how to handle white-space inside an element
	word-spacing	Specifies the space between words in a text

direction: direction: ltr|rtl|initial|inherit;

shadow: text-shadow: h-shadow v-shadow blur-radius color|none|initial|inherit;

•	CSS Filers (blur, brightness, contrast, drop shadow, rotate hue, invest, change the opacity, saturate, sepia and grayscale) an image.  
filter: none | blur() | brightness() | contrast() | drop-shadow() | grayscale() | hue-rotate() | invert() | opacity() | saturate() | sepia() 


blur(px)	Applies a blur effect to the image. A larger value will create more blur.
If no value is specified, 0 is used.	


brightness(%)	Adjusts the brightness of the image.

0% will make the image completely black.
100% (1) is default and represents the original image.


contrast(%)	Adjusts the contrast of the image.

0% will make the image completely black.
100% (1) is default, and represents the original image.
Values over 100% will provide results with more contrast.	


drop-shadow(h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color)	Applies a drop shadow effect to the image.

Possible values:
h-shadow - Required. Specifies a pixel value for the horizontal shadow. Negative values place the shadow to the left of the image.

v-shadow - Required. Specifies a pixel value for the vertical shadow. Negative values place the shadow above the image.

blur - Optional. This is the third value, and must be in pixels. Adds a blur effect to the shadow. A

spread - Optional. This is the fourth value, and must be in pixels. Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, a
nd negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. 

color - Optional. Adds a color to the shadow. If not specified, the color depends on the browser (often black).


grayscale(%)	Converts the image to grayscale.

0% (0) is default and represents the original image.
100% will make the image completely gray (used for black and white images).


hue-rotate(deg)	Applies a hue rotation on the image. 
The value defines the number of degrees around the color circle the image samples will be adjusted. 0deg is default, and represents the original image.


invert(%)	Inverts the samples in the image.

0% (0) is default and represents the original image.
100% will make the image completely inverted.


opacity(%)	Sets the opacity level for the image. The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where:

0% is completely transparent.
100% (1) is default and represents the original image (no transparency).


saturate(%)	Saturates the image.

0% (0) will make the image completely un-saturated.
100% is default and represents the original image.
Values over 100% provides super-saturated results.


sepia(%)	Converts the image to sepia.

0% (0) is default and represents the original image.
100% will make the image completely sepia.
