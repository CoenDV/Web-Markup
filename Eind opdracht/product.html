				<h3>Alone time</h3>
				Most gyms aren&#39;t opened 24&#47;7 so with online coaching you can make your own scheme to train.
				Another benefit is that you are most likely to do this alone with a coach so there are no bystanders that can look at or judge you.

				or host a livestream &#40;with an app such as teams or zoom&#41;.
